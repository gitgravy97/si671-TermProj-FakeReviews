# SI671 Term Project :: Fake Review Detection on Amazon\

## Overview / Intention

- This was a term project for a data mining course of mine
- Intention was to explore if we could train models to discriminate fraudulent reviews on Amazon from legitimate ones
- Final performance: managed to achieve F1 in low-80's with recall scores in upper-80's

## Structure

- The data is in `data`
- `docs` contains copies of our final paper, the project poster from our departmental project/research fair, and reference notes from related readings
- `pickled-models` contains our pickled backups of most-successful models
- `Main.ipynb` is the sole notebook copied over from the original project repo and does retain unnecessary reference to Google Collab, where the project was originally hosted
